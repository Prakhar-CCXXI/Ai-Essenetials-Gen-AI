* Core abilities:

  * Language translation
  * Sentence completion
  * Text classification
  * Question answering (QA)

### **2. Generative AI Fundamentals**

* What Generative AI is and how it generates *new* content
* Difference between:

  * Predictive ML models → produce labels or probabilities
  * Generative models → create new text, images, audio, etc.
* Learning patterns in unstructured data
* Real-world applications powered by GenAI

### **3. Machine Learning Basics**

* How ML models learn relationships from input data
* Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning
